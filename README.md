The Karasuno High Player Gallery is a web-based project that showcases the players of Karasuno High Volleyball Team from Haikyuu!!. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, and features a visually engaging design with glassmorphism cards, gradient backgrounds, glowing text, and dynamic particle animations. Each player is displayed on a fixed-size card for consistent layout, and users can click on a card to open a modal popup showing detailed information about the player. The gallery also includes a sidebar filter menu that allows users to sort players by position, making it easy to explore the team’s roster. A faint Karasuno logo watermark in the background adds a subtle stylistic touch, and a footer provides project information and reference links.

The project is fully responsive and adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes, ensuring that the gallery looks good on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The header features the Karasuno team banner with glowing text that enhances the visual appeal, while the particle animation flows from the bottom to the top of the page, creating a dynamic effect without interfering with the content. All player images are standardized in size to maintain a clean and uniform presentation across the site.

This gallery is ideal for fans of Haikyuu!! who want a dedicated interactive space to explore the Karasuno volleyball team. The project also demonstrates the use of modern web design techniques, such as glassmorphism, gradient animations, modals, and responsive layouts. It is intended for educational and fan purposes, and all images and character information are used respectfully for non-commercial purposes.

To get started, clone the repository, ensure all player images and the header banner are placed in the images/ folder, and open the index.html file in a modern browser. Users can then browse through the player cards, use the sidebar filter to view specific positions, and click on individual cards to learn more about each player. Optional enhancements include adding a search bar for player names, incorporating additional team statistics, or adding more visual effects to the cards and modals.
